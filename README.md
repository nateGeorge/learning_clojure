# learning_clojure
This is a record of how I learned clojure from nothing.

Currently, I'm still learning, so this is a work in progress.

# Installing locally
I use Ubuntu, and so I first tried opening up a terminal and typing

`clojure`

It gave me an error, saying `The program 'clojure' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
sudo apt install clojure1.6`

So I did `sudo apt install clojure1.6`, then it worked.  But apparantly, you want to use [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) instead, because it handles dependencies, etc.

# Resources
Here is a list, in order, of the resources I used to learn clojure:
http://www.tryclj.com/
http://clojurekoans.com/ (one set of solutions [here](https://github.com/viebel/clojure-koans/tree/master/src/koans))
